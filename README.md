# Structure Viewer

A short project built using tailwind, react and the 'React Flow' component.

Mix of own code and AI. 

A tree view of organisational structure, with nodes representing departments and their metrics. Sliding scale to indicate node health along with customisable options like the threshold and some minor colour/text changes.

Uses all hard coded nodes/edges for initial load, long term idea would be to build/store this and load/save it.
